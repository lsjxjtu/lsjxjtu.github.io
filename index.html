<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>Sijia Liu is currently an Associate Professor at the CSE department of Michigan State University, an Affiliated Professor at IBM Research, and an MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab affiliated PI. He received the Ph.D. degree (with All-University Doctoral Prize) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Syracuse University, NY, USA, in 2016. He was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2016-2017, and a Research Staff Member at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in 2018-2020. His research interests include scalable and trustworthy AI, e.g. scalable optimization for deep models, machine unlearning for vision and language models, AI robustness, and data-model efficiency.</p>
<p>His accomplishments have also been recognized through numerous competitive awards. He received the NSF CAREER Award in 2024 for his work on zeroth-order optimization and was named to the AAAI New Faculty Highlights in 2023 for his contributions to scalable optimization for robust AI. In 2025, he was honored with the Withrow Rising Scholar Award (the highest recognition for junior faculty in MSU’s College of Engineering), and received the Aharon Katzir Young Investigator Award from the International Neural Network Society (INNS) for foundational contributions to robust and efficient neural networks. He has also received industry faculty awards such as the Amazon Research Award (2024) and the Cisco Research Awards (2022–2024). According to 2025 <a href="https://csrankings.org/">CSRankings</a>, he holds the #1 research productivity rank at MSU over the past decade, with a score of 89. His research has received several best paper honors, including the Best Paper Runner-Up Award at UAI 2022, IBM Pat Goldberg Best Paper Award Finalist (2020 and 2024), and the Best Student Paper Award at ICASSP 2017.</p>
<p>Dr. Liu is a Senior Member of IEEE and an active contributor to the research community. He serves on the IEEE Signal Processing Society’s Machine Learning for Signal Processing Technical Committee and as Associate Editor for both IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing and IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems. He has served as Area Chair for ICASSP and ML conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, and AISTATS. He founded the New Frontiers in Adversarial Machine Learning Workshop series (ICML/NeurIPS 2021–2024) and was a Co-Chair of the Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL) in 2024. In addition, he has delivered numerous tutorials on trustworthy and scalable ML at leading conferences, including ICASSP, AAAI, CVPR, and NeurIPS.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>My research spans the areas of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL), optimization, computer vision, security, signal processing and data science, 
with a focus on developing learning algorithms and theory, and robust and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). 
These research themes provide a solid foundation for reaching my <b>long-term research objective: Making AI systems safe and scalable</b>. 
As AI moves from the lab into the real world (e.g., autonomous vehicles), ensuring its safety becomes a paramount requirement prior to 
its deployment. Moreover, as datasets, ML/DL models, and learning tasks become increasingly complex, 
getting ML/DL to scale calls for new advances in learning algorithm design.
Thus, robustness and scalability  underscore my current and future research, and of course, these two goals are intertwined.  
More  broadly,  the  study  towards robust and scalable AI could make a significant impact on machine learning theories, 
and induce more promising applications in, e.g., automated ML, meta-learning, privacy and security, hardware design, and big data analysis. 
I intend to seek a new learning frontier when the current learning algorithms become infeasible, and formalize  foundations  of  secure  learning.</p>
